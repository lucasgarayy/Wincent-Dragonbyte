# Binary with a Twist
### Statement 
What is the smallest base larger than 2 in which the integer $n$ contains only the digits 0 and 1?

### Input format
The first line of each input file contains the number $t$ of test cases.

Each of the following $t$ lines contains a single integer $n$ (in base 10).

### Output format
For each test case output a single line with a single number.

If $n$ cannot be represented using 1s and 0s in any base larger than 2, output $-1$.

Otherwise, output an integer $b$: the smallest base larger than 2 in which $n$â€™s representation contains only 1s and 0s.
