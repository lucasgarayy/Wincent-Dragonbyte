# My Wincent DragonByte Solutions

Hey there!

This is where I keep all my solutions for the Wincent DragonByte coding challenges. It's been quite the journey working through these problems, and I wanted to organize everything in one place.

Big thanks to **Wincent** for creating these awesome challenges! If you want to check out more of his work, head over to [the competition website](https://www.wincentdragonbyte.com/).

## What's Inside

Each folder contains my attempt at solving a specific challenge. Here's what you'll find in every folder:

- **Problem_statement.md** - The original problem description and requirements
- **Solution.md** - My explanation of the approach, thought process, and any interesting insights
- The actual code files with my implementation
- Test cases (when applicable)

## Repository Structure

```plaintext
.
├── 
├── Problem_1/
│   ├── Problem_statement.md
│   ├── Solution.md
│   └── [code files]
├── Problem_2/
│   ├── Problem_statement.md
│   ├── Solution.md
│   └── [code files]
└── ...
└── README.md        ← You are here!
```

## My Approach

I try to keep things clean and well-documented. For each problem, I:

1. Break down the problem requirements
2. Think through different approaches
3. Implement the solution with clear, readable code
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document my reasoning and any trade-offs

Feel free to browse around and see how I tackled each challenge. If you spot any improvements or have questions, I'm always open to feedback!
